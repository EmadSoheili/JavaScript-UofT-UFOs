## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is creating an interactive webpage. In this page, there are some static data such as paragraphs and text and a dynamic table which can be filtered.
The previous project contained just one filter, but in this project multiple filter should be considered. This way we can see just a portion of data which we are interested in.
